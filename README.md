# Housing-Prices-Prediction
[Kaggle Competition for Housing Prices Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

# Decription
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the housing prices for the test set. As this is a competition, the goal is also to achieve higher acuracy and thus obtaining a good rank.
